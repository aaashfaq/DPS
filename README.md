## Artificial Intelligence Challange Assesment Test

Instructions have been followed as given in the https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/vertex-ai-custom-models#1

#### Prediction of the fuel efficiency of a vehicle using a basic regression with TensorFlow

DATASET: "https://storage.googleapis.com/io-vertex-codelab/auto-mpg.csv"
Auto MPG dataset from Kaggle
#### Specification: 
Tensorflow model
Train:Test Split= 80:20%

#### Prediction 
1) Deployed end point can be used to do the prediction by 
"https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/locations/us-central1/endpoints/7993519902675697664?cloudshell=true&project=dps-usama"
                                    OR
2) Set the path to the trainer folder after downloading the project and run "python3 predict.py"

#### Files
There are three folders in the repository:

1. model-3818920542614847488
2. mpg/model
3. trainer
4. 
The trainer folder contains the code used to build the ML model in python. The other two folders are generated in Vertex AI (Google Console)
